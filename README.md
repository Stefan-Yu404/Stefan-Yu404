I have done some works about data visualization and analysis in astronomy with some machine learning algorithms using python. There are two outcomes published in APJ as the third and second authors respectively called '3D Morphology of Open Clusters in the Solar Neighborhood with Gaia EDR 3: Its Relation to Cluster Dynamics' with url: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10508.pdf and 'Disruption of Hierarchical Clustering in the Vela OB2 Complex and the Cluster Pair Collinder 135 and UBC7 with Gaia EDR3: Evidence of Supernova Quenching' with url:https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07658.pdf. 

If you are looking for someone who can do data analyasis, process and eventually visualization, you may contact me with e-mail.

Now, I am learning deep learning, and try to predict stock direction (rise and down) with CNN.
